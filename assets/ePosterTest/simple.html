      <h1>The Shock-Driven Outflows of Tidal Disruption Events</h1>
      <p>The first light from tidal disruption events, and an optical emission mechanism<br>

      <p class="notice"><strong>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) begin when a star is torn apart by the tidal forces from a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Approximately half of the star will remain bound, and come back for another round...</strong><br />

TDEs are farily interesting because they might help us identify lower-mass black holes. Most quasi-steadily accreting black holes have masses closer to ~billions
of solar masses. However, SMBHs with masses greater than about ~40 million times solar will instead be swallowed whole. These TDEs might light up otherwise quiescent galaxies, 
offering us a window into the lower-mass portion of the supermassive black hole populaiton.

<p class="notice"> <strong>General relativistic GR precession causes the falling-back gas to hit itself. This should emit light and help the returning material form a disk. As I'll show later, this can also drive outflows if the shock is strong enough. </strong><br />

Notably, these shocks might be strong enough to unbind a significant amount of material....
